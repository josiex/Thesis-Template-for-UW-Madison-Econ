A crude template for dissertation that fulfills formatting requirement of the Department of Economics and the Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin - Madison

I used quite a few packages for my papers, to include landscape tables, table notes, footnotes and reference links, a different font and so on. 

Thus, my papers do not compile well with existing templates kindly provided by the Maths and Computer Science department. 

The title page is very crude, but easy to edit.

To include chapters, copy paste everything between \begin{document} and \end{document}, EXCLUDING appendices and references. 

The template uses the article document class, part name has been renamed to chapter.

It should be fairly self explanatory. If not, let me know.
