	abstract = {Recently, some charities have been attacked for spending an "excessive" portion of their resources on fundraising. This paper shows how competition for donations can push fundraising shares to high levels even when donors dislike charities that spend a large portion of receipts on fundraising. It also considers a case in which donors take account of the productivity of fundraising in generating gifts from others. In the light of the models developed in the paper, a variety of regulatory strategies are assessed from the dissemination of information to the establishment of a federated fund drive.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the field of industrial organization has relied on two unrelatedtheories--the cross-section theory and the growth-of-firms theory--to explain cross-industrydifferences in concentration and within-industry skewness. The two approaches are based on verydifferent mathematical structures and few researchers have attempted to relate them to each other.Inthis book, John Sutton unifies the two approaches through a theory that rests on three simpleprinciples. The first two, a "survivor principle" that says that firms will not pursue loss-makingstrategies, and an "arbitrage principle" that says that if a profitable opportunity is available,some firm will take it, suffice to define a set of possible outcomes. The third, the "symmetryprinciple," says that the strategy used by a new entrant into any submarket depends neither on theentrants identity nor on its history in other submarkets. This allows researchers to bring togetherthe roles of strategic interactions and of independence effects. The result is that theconsiderations motivating the cross-section tradition and those motivating the growth-of-firmstradition both drop out within a single game-theoretic model.This book follows Sutton's Sunk Costsand Market Structure, published by MIT Press in 1991.},
